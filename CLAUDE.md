# CLAUDE.md — zacharymays-site

## Shared research-system content

All `/research-system/*` pages are thin wrappers around
`@zacharymays-cpu/oci-research-system`, a git-installed npm package pinned to
an exact commit in `package.json` (source: `/Users/Zack/oci-research-system-content`,
also consumed by `/Users/Zack/organizational-coercion-index`).

**If you are editing anything under `src/app/research-system/`:** the content
itself does not live here — edit it in the source repo instead, then follow
the update procedure in that repo's `CLAUDE.md` (bump its version, push,
update the pinned commit here, clean build, push). There is no CI syncing
this automatically.
